Here are cone schematics. 

This piece permits having a precise ball detection all around the robot from the border of the robot to 2 meters away.

I've used FreeCAD with the optical module to make some simulations and find an appropriate design depending on the robot's specifications.

You can thus find here the simulation (or at least one of them) and the final design : )
